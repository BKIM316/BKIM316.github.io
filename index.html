    <p>Hey guys! My name is Brennan Kim and I'm a third-year business administration student emphasizing in either Finance or Marketing.

    <h2>Professional Aspirations</h2>

    <p>In the future, I hope to work either as a strategy consultant, financial analyst, or in product marketing. Although I haven't definitively narrowed down exactly what I want to do, I'm keeping my options open and just learning from every opportunity possible. Ideally, I'd want to work in the entertainment industry preferably either within the sports or television world. Most recently, I worked as a Consumer Insights Intern at FOX Entertainment which opened up my eyes to the world of marketing. Beforehand, I had little to no experience in this field but after the internship I've had a newfound interest in Marketing which is why I'm torn between emphasizing in the former or going down the Finance route.   </p>
